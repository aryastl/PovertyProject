									<h3>Inadequate Access to Clean Water and Nutritious Food</h3>
								</header>
								<p>More than 2 billion people lack access to clean water and 800 million suffer from hunger. Food and water insecurity are big reasons people can not escape poverty. Even if clean water resources are available they are located far from poor rural communities causing women and girls to collectively spend 200 million hours every day, taking time away from getting an education or having a job.</p>

									<h3>Little to No Access to Livelihoods or Jobs</h3>
								</header><br>
								<p>Due to dwindling access to productive land, often due to conflict, overpopulation, or climate change and overexploitation of resources is putting increasing pressure on many traditional livelihoods causes many people to lack access to a job. While inconsistent work and low paying jobs can land a family in poverty, absolutely no work means that a family can’t get by without assistance.</p>

									<h3>Conflict</h3>
								</header><br>
								<p>Large scale violence that we see in places like Syria destroy infrastructure, and cause people to flee. This forces families to sell or leave behind all their assets. During periods of violence, female-headed households become very common. Women often have difficulty getting a well-paying job, and they are typically excluded from community decision-making, their families are particularly vulnerable.</p>

									<h3>Inequality</h3>
								</header>
								<p>There are many different types of inequality in the world, from economic to social inequalities like gender, caste systems, or tribal affiliations. Regardless, these inequalities mean that the people affected don’t have the tools they desperately need to get ahead, and for already vulnerable families, this can mean the difference between being poor or living in extreme poverty.</p>

									<h3>Poor Education</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Many families can’t afford to send their children to school, in need them to work. More don’t see a benefit in educating girls. Education is often referred to as the great equalizer, because education can open the door to jobs and other resources and skills that a family needs to not just survive, but thrive. </p>

									<h3>Climate Change</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Climate change has the power to push more than 100 million people[p into poverty over the next ten years. As it is, climate events like drought, flooding, and severe storms disproportionately impact communities already living in poverty because many of the world’s poorest populations rely on farming or hunting and gathering to eat and earn a living.</p>

									<h3>Lack of Infrastructure</h3>
								</header>
								<p>A lack of infrastructure can isolate communities living in rural areas. Traveling farther distances to access basic services not only takes time, it costs money, keeping families in poverty. Isolation limits opportunity, and without opportunity, many find it difficult, if not impossible, to escape extreme poverty.</p>

									<h3>Limited Capacity of the Government</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Not every government can provide the social welfare programs that people in the United States have access to. Without this safety net, there’s nothing to stop vulnerable families from backsliding further into extreme poverty if something goes wrong. Ineffective governments also contribute to several of the other causes of extreme poverty mentioned above because they are unable to provide necessary infrastructure.</p>

									<h3>Lack of Reserves</h3>
								</header>
								<p>When there is a drought, conflict, or illness, there is little money saved and few assets on hand to help. Families are pulling their children from school, and sell off everything they own to eat in order to cope with this issue. For communities constantly facing climate extremes or prolonged conflict, the repeated shocks can send a family spiraling into extreme poverty and prevent them from ever recovering.</p>
