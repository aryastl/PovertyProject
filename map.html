<h2>Sudan</h2>
<p>As of 2009, 46.5 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Nine out of 10 people live on less than a dollar per day. About 40 percent of the population lacks access to safe drinking water. Sudan has the largest number of internally displaced people in the world. More than half a million breastfeeding mothers and children are in need of supplementary food.
26.6 percent of the population will likely not live past the age of 40. Serious illnesses among children, caused by malnutrition and dehydration, cannot be treated because of limited medical supplies, facilities and ill-equipped services. As a result, half of Sudan’s children are not in school.
This is problematic. People of Sudan need our help to get access to these necessary resources. We can help in many ways.</p>
<br>
<h2>Egypt</h2>
<p>This high poverty rate in Egypt has affected children, many of whom are malnourished. In mid-2014, 31 percent of children under the age of 5 were considered to have stunted growth because of malnutrition. Often, families who have little money opt to spend it on cheaper food options rather than nutritious food.
Poverty in Egypt affects not only many children, but also populations living in rural areas. When compared to urban areas in Egypt, the poverty rate in rural areas was 37 percent higher as of July 2016.</p>
<br>
<h2>Iraq</h2>
<p>With widespread insecurity since 2014, Iraq is in a state of humanitarian crisis with 10 million people in need and more than 3 million internally displaced persons.
According to the World Bank, “the standard of living has deteriorated and a noticeable share of the population has fallen into poverty or is extremely vulnerable to falling into poverty.” In 2014, poverty reached 22.5 percent nationwide.
It’s up to us to make these statistics to lower, and help the people of Iraq economically.</p>

<h2>Haiti</h2>
<p>24.7 percent of Haitians live in extreme poverty, which is less than $1.25 per day.
approximately 59 percent of Haitians live on less than $2 a day.
Haitian residents are all too familiar with natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Hurricane Matthew, a category four storm which struck Haiti in October 2017, killed 546 people and affected two million more.
Approximately 100,000 children under the age of five are malnourished, while 30 percent of the overall population is considered food insecure.
About one in two Haitians use unsanitary water, which has been proven to cause illness. In fact, about 80 percent of illnesses in developing countries are due in part to unsanitary water.</p>
<br>
<h2>Bolivia</h2>
<p>Bolivia is a state plagued with inequality and inadequate development, making it the poorest nation in South America.
Poverty affects the majority of the population, with almost 40 percent of Bolivians living in extreme poverty. Despite the land’s rich natural resources, Bolivia’s lack of human development hinders the state’s economic, social and political progress.
In rural areas, many people are forced to drink contaminated water, as they are without clean, natural or portable water alternatives. This puts communities at significant risk for disease and illness. Since the 1990s, access to clean water has improved significantly. However, this improvement is concentrated in urban areas, rather than the rural areas where sanitation is needed most.</p>

<h2>Afghanistan</h2>
<p>The Afghanistan  government estimates that 42 percent of the country's total population lives below the national poverty line. Another 20 percent of the people live close to that line and are highly vulnerable to the risk of falling into poverty.
More than 50% of children under 5 years are chronically malnourished (stunted) and one-fifth of Afghan women of child-bearing age are underweight. Average life expectancy is 62 years, and adult literacy stands at just 28 percent.
All people living in poverty in Afghanistan are desperate for food and water. Others that can afford to help are strongly encouraged to donate to provide food for the malnourished.</p>
<br>
<h2>Bangladesh</h2>
<p>At 31.5 percent, Bangladesh has the highest percentage of its population living below the national poverty line in South Asia.
Although the official unemployment rate is listed as 4.1 percent, it is estimated that about 40 percent of the population is underemployed. Many individuals who only work a few hours a week for very low wages are officially considered employed, despite the highly insubstantial means available to them.</p>

<h2>Ethiopia</h2>
<p>One of the poorest countries in the world, Ethiopia has an estimated 35 million people who are subjected to abject poverty. This is roughly around 44 percent of the current population.
One of the major factors contributing to rural poverty is the lack of rain. Droughts cause a lot of poor farming families to live without food crops, leading to hunger and famine.
Another cause of the high poverty rate in the country is illiteracy. Only a few have access to sound education. Millions of Ethiopians are unable to access quality education. Some even prefer to work rather than study because their priority is their own survival and their family’s survival.
The People in Ethiopia need your help, because their government is not economically able to support their suffering citizens.</p>
<br>
<h2>Liberia</h2>
<p>Because of the country’s low agricultural production and poor household incomes, Liberia has suffered from chronic food insecurity since the civil war.
The people of Liberia face many hardships. The country's infant mortality rate is among the 20 highest in the world, and it is listed as one of the bottom 10 countries on the United Nations' Human Development Index, which measures life expectancy, education and income.
People in Liberia lack access natural resources, and It’s up to us to provide them for these people.</p>
